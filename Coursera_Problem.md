# Analysing Finland and Sweden cities



Local residents of Thailand are well aware of their own country's low quality and close-minded education system. And in the wake of [recent events where Thai teachers were caught on tape allegedly beating  kinddergarten students](https://thethaiger.com/news/national/nonthaburi-teacher-allegedly-beat-students-witnesses-may-face-charges-video), seeking  better countries for raising families has become the hot topic amongst parents.

The 2 countries that are highly revered amongst Thai community for their education, are **Finland** and **Sweden**.

In this project, I will explore cities of these countries. The goal is to visualize and analyze if we can rate them based on how suitable they are for raising families with data we can query from Foursquare and scrape from other sources.
