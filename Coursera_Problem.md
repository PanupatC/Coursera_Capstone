## The Problem

Thai parents are in dire need for a new place to raise their families. They need to search for the most suitable places they can potentially send their children abroard for school.

## The Background Discussion

Local residents of Thailand are well aware of their country's low quality and close-minded education system. And in the wake of [recent events where Thai teachers were caught on tape allegedly beating  kinddergarten students](https://thethaiger.com/news/national/nonthaburi-teacher-allegedly-beat-students-witnesses-may-face-charges-video), seeking  better countries for raising families has become the hot topic amongst parents.

The 2 countries that are highly revered amongst Thai community for their education, are **Finland** and **Sweden**.

In this project, I would like to explore the cities of these countries. The goal is to visualize and analyze from the data we can query from Foursquare to determine the possibility of rating those cities on  how suitable they are for raising families.
